## What is a_മ്മ Indic ML?
a_മ്മ (pronounced as `/ˈɛ mʌ/`) is a place where people and startups collaborate to build datasets and models to accelerate Machine Learning in India. Today, Machine Learning is an essential technology that we need to incorporate into our daily life. According to Andrew Ng - a computer scientist and an entrepreneur referred ML as the new electricity. Although ML at its core is a bit complex, because of great tools that are available to the public, now it's easy for a developer to get started with it. But that's not enough to address the problems of people in diverse and developing countries like India. So, it's important to contribute useful data and solve some founding Machine Learning problems. 

## How a_മ്മ works?
All the collected data to that date will be made public at frequent intervals. Release days might vary based on project initialization date. Anyone with Karma coins will be able to access early data.

## What's my gain and what is Karma?
Structured data generation is costly. So, it's important to acknowledge the efforts put by the people who are contributing. We believe this might encourage people to contribute. Contributors will gain `Karma` coins as a reward. Karma coins are required to access early data. Contributed data will be validated by a human. One such successful data validation will reward Karma coins to the generator.

## How Karma works?
Karma coins generated for a specific repository can only be used to access that repository. It's not transferable. Value of a unit data will change dynamically. The person who owns the highest Karma will get 100% access to verified data until that moment. Others will get access to a relative portion of data based on their Karma. You wouldn't be able to deduce your Karma to access data in parts. Only one-time whole spend is available for now.
