## Why Indic Named Entity Recognition in NLP

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is one of the fundamental problems of Natural Language Processing (NLP). An NER's purpose is to identify useful entities within any text document. Here's an example of what NER could do. 

Within NLP as a whole, NER algorithms in some non-Indian languages (especially in English) shown relatively great results while compared to other NLP algorithms. NER helps a lot in structured data generation from unstructured data. This induced great momentum in information extraction tasks. Common examples of information extraction tasks include 'detection of people and dates from emails', extraction of information from news articles and documents, generation of information cards from raw text, document searching and entity extraction in dialog systems like chatbots.

Indic NER algorithms are very important. In India, people are going through a transition to digital services. So, it is very important to build the foundation of Indic NLP to make this transition smooth and get products ready to use once this transition is complete. Indic NER belongs to the very bottom of such foundation based on the practical usability. This will reduce the headaches from the user perspective for communications and interactions, by letting them act in their native languages. This will also help in digitalizing and get insights during document digitalization. Commercial developers don't have to wait, instead could focus on their products from the very beginning.

## What a_മ്മ is doing in Indic NER and how to contribute?

a_മ്മ's role in Indic NER is to encourage training data from contributors and make it available to the public. We have released an early version of a data collection tool '**Named Entity Tagger**' which is available now online [here](https://amma-ner-frontend.herokuapp.com). 

We primarily expect the community contributions in the form of tagged data through '**Named Entity Tagger**' tool. We also expect contributions as '**a_മ്മ after effects**' which includes Machine Learning Models, research contributions, engineering ideas.
